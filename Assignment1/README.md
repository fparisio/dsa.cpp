# Assignment 1

This repository contains solutions to various pattern printing exercises implemented in C++. Each exercise is encapsulated in its own class, inheriting from a common base class `PatternBase`. The base class provides a framework for executing the pattern printing logic, while derived classes implement specific patterns.

## File Structure
- `patterns.h` and `patterns.cpp`: Define the `PatternBase` class and its derived classes for each pattern.
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main function to execute the pattern printing exercises.
- `Makefile`: A simple Makefile to compile the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `grade_calculator.h` and `grade_calculator.cpp`: Header and implementation files for the average grade calculator function.
- `1.cpp`: Implementation of the average grade calculator function.
- `2.cpp ... 8.cpp`: Implementation of the different patterns to print.


## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the project, use the provided Makefile. Simply run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make build
```

This will compile the source files and to run the executable, use:

```bash
make run
```

To rebuild the project, use:

```bash
make rebuild
```
To clean up the compiled files, use:

```bash
make clean
```
